          <p> Over the past few years, I have observed many fascinating trends and changes in the playstyle of the NBA. As the world moves into a more data-driven and analyitical world, the NBA world followed suit, as many teams now prioritize the 3-pointer because of its higher expected value over a large sample size. I used Python to analyze NBA data that shows "Player of the Week" winners dating back to 1985. As the NBA changes, its best players and their playstyles should change too.  I specifically chose these analysis questions because their answers help illustrate these changes over time. I loved doing this analysis because the numbers "tell the story behind the story". I used Matplotlib and Numpy in Python to plot the data. I found the CSV file <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/jacobbaruch/nba-player-of-the-week" target = "_blank"> here. </a>  In addition, I analyzed a JSON file consisting of wholesale data. I was curious to the differences in the spending of different businesses in different regions. So, I chose analysis questions pertaining to my curiosities. I believe that the results are meaningful. </p>
